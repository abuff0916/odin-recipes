    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an easy recipe for baked pasta shells, stuffed with a mix of cheeses and topped with marinara sauce. This recipe is easily customizable, so feel free to add sauteed greens, sausage, or any other ingredients if you so choose.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>20 jumbo pasta shells</li>
        <li>2/3 lb ricotta cheese <i>(about 2 heaping cups)</i></li>
        <li>2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese <i>divided</i></li>
        <li>8 tsp finely chopped parsley leaves</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2/3 of 24 oz jar marinara sauce <i>(3 cups, divided)</i></li>
        <li>4 tsp finely grated cheese <i>(Parmesan or Romano)</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 375Â°F.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the shells and cook according to package directions. Drain,then briefly rinse with cold water until cool enough to handle.</li>
        <li>Place the following ingredients in a large bowl, and stir to combine:
            <ul>
                <li>ricotta</li>
                <li>2 cups of mozzarella</li>
                <li>parsley</li>
                <li>salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>
        Taste and add more salt, if needed.
        </li>
        <li>Spread 1 cup of the sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Stuff each shell with about 1 heaping tablespoon of the mozzarella filling and place filling-side up in the dish. If
        some shells split during the cooking process, you may have a few fragments left over, but you should end up with about 2
        dozen shells in the dish.</li>
        <li>Top the shells evenly with the remaining 2 cups sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella and Parmesan or
        Pecorino.</li>
        <li>Bake uncovered until the cheese is melted and the sauce is bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
